#  Description
This is a criminal doctor script made with the ESX develop branch. 
PS: All coords and camera coords are made exactly for me, so you might have to rewrite just that - Just have that in mind :D

# To-do
Some optimization.


# What does it do?
Basically, its a doctor script. What more can I say..
You go whereever you need to go, press E and get healed.

# Reminder
Keep the cost HIGH, else players will use this more than a hospital. Yes, this is a script made for RP servers.
